On the speedometer side, the LEDs seem to be used primarily as warning indicators. Hack your car's dashboard lights and make them rock!¿Hablas español? For all you who have done the 4WD conversion the following is how i got the 4WD dash light to illuminate after the conversion without using. Is there a hack to shut off the brake light on my dash. It's on due to an ABS issue which I don't care to fix. I'm just trying to get the light off to pass.

Take out your dash pod. There are four Phillips screws and three connectors. Turn the pod over and notice the following open light hole. That hole on the other side has the green 4WD indicator. What we are trying to illuminate. This light bulb routes to this connector which then goes to the ECM through the Green & Black wire. Hold your dash button until the light on it starts to flash blue. Turn up the volume on your phone and set the Dash button next to your phones speaker and click the next connect button. Once it connects, it will ask you for a product do not select a product instead close the app out. Great! Your button is now hacked! Use your wifi connected computer (or whatever) and connect to "Amazon ConfigureMe". Follow the instructions to setup wifi, and then your button's light should be off. If you complete the setup correctly, when you push the Amazon dash button, It will light up white (connected to wifi) then turn Orange/red (cannot make purchase).Estimated Reading Time: 5 mins.
